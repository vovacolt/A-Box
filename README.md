Description
=========================
A-Box is a Web Application for creating VR programs in a browser based on A-Frame and Ruby on Rails

The main idea of the project is that developers of desktop VR applications are accustomed to visual design systems and hardly accept programming in AFarme. There are also novice developers who do not have sufficient knowledge in designing Web-applications. Therefore, they need to develop a convenient Web service with a minimalistic design that allows you to create Web-VR applications on AFrame using a visual environment.
